\begin{abstract}
This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a one‑to‑many (1:N) face recognition system conforming to the NIST FRVT Ongoing 1:N API. Our implementation leverages the RetinaFace model for robust face detection and alignment, and a TransFace embedding network fine‑tuned on VGGFace2 for discriminative feature extraction. We integrate these components into the FRVT enrollment, finalization, and identification pipeline, enforcing single‑threaded, CPU‑only execution to match the NIST test harness environment. Experiments on the provided gallery and probe datasets demonstrate competitive false negative identification rates (FNIR) at low false positive identification rates (FPIR) and adherence to NIST timing constraints. Detailed FNIR vs. FPIR curves, cumulative match characteristic (CMC) metrics, and median processing times for template creation, enrollment finalization, and search are reported. Our results confirm that the proposed system meets the performance and speed requirements for operational deployment.

\section{Introduction}
Facial recognition technology has become critical for a wide range of applications, including security, access control, and identity management. The NIST FRVT Ongoing 1:N benchmark provides a standardized evaluation framework for one‑to‑many identification tasks, ensuring algorithms meet rigorous accuracy and timing requirements. For Adiance Technologies, achieving FRVT certification is essential to validate and promote our facial recognition products. In this work, we describe our end‑to‑end implementation of the FRVT 1:N API, covering enrollment, finalization, and identification stages. Our contributions include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Integration of RetinaFace for face detection and five‑point alignment within the FRVT API.
  \item Deployment of a TransFace embedding model, fine‑tuned on VGGFace2 with extensive data augmentation, for robust feature extraction.
  \item Implementation of template fusion, serialization, and brute‑force cosine similarity search under single‑threaded, CPU‑only constraints.
  \item Comprehensive evaluation on the NIST‑provided datasets, reporting FNIR vs. FPIR curves, CMC metrics, and timing measurements.
\end{itemize}
\section{Overview of Training Period}
The development of the FRVT Ongoing 1:N face recognition system spanned nine weeks of intensive learning, coding, and debugging during my internship at Adiance Technologies. This period involved understanding the FRVT API, acquiring C++ proficiency, integrating deep learning frameworks, and ensuring compliance with the NIST test harness. Below, I detail the weekly progression, highlighting objectives, activities, challenges, and outcomes, which collectively shaped the final implementation.

\subsection{Week 1: Understanding FRVT Documentation and Project Scope}
During the first week, my primary goal was to comprehend the FRVT Ongoing 1:N API specifications and define the project’s scope. I studied the NIST-provided documentation (version 3.1), focusing on the enrollment, finalization, and identification phases, as well as the expected input/output formats like templates and candidate lists. I also explored the differences between 1:1 and 1:N recognition, noting the complexity of one-to-many searches. The documentation was dense and technical, requiring multiple readings to understand terms like consolidated galleries and timing constraints (e.g., 10 seconds for 1 million templates). By the end, I had a clear roadmap, identifying key milestones such as face detection, feature extraction, and search implementation.

Challenges: Deciphering the extensive FRVT documentation was time-consuming, especially understanding how to structure the gallery and meet performance benchmarks. Outcome: I outlined a development plan, gaining confidence in the project’s direction.
\subsection{Week 2: Learning C++ Basics and Development Setup}
Week 2 focused on building a foundation in C++, a language I was less familiar with, and setting up the development environment. I completed online tutorials covering syntax, pointers, and object-oriented programming, then installed tools like g++, CMake, and Git on my Ubuntu system. I wrote small programs (e.g., manipulating vectors) to get comfortable with manual memory management—a stark contrast to higher-level languages I’d used before. Setting up CMake to manage dependencies was tricky but essential for integrating libraries later. This week laid the groundwork for coding the FRVT API.

Challenges: Adjusting to C++’s compilation process and memory handling was daunting. Outcome: I could compile and debug basic C++ code, preparing me for the next steps.

\subsection{Week 3:Integrating ONNX Runtime and OpenCV in C++}
In Week 3, I tackled integrating ONNX Runtime and OpenCV into my C++ project for model inference and image processing. I studied the ONNX Runtime C++ API to load and run a sample ONNX model, then used OpenCV to preprocess images (e.g., resizing to 128x128). Combining the two, I built a pipeline where OpenCV loaded images and ONNX Runtime inferred outputs. Debugging issues like segmentation faults from mismatched tensor shapes was a steep learning curve, but I resolved them by carefully aligning data formats.

Challenges: Ensuring library compatibility and fixing runtime errors took significant effort. Outcome: I successfully ran a simple ONNX model on images, validating the integration.
\subsection{Week 4: Implementing Face Detection and Alignment with RetinaFace}
Week 4 was dedicated to implementing face detection and alignment using the RetinaFace ONNX model. I wrote C++ code to detect faces and extract five landmarks, then developed an alignment function to standardize face crops. Optimizing detection for various image conditions (e.g., lighting, pose) required tuning thresholds, which I tested with sample datasets. This step was critical for ensuring consistent input to the embedding model later.

Challenges: Balancing detection accuracy and minimizing false positives was tough. Outcome: I achieved reliable face detection and alignment, ready for feature extraction.

\subsection{Week 5: Feature Extraction with TransFace and Template Generation}
In Week 5, I implemented feature extraction using the TransFace model, fine-tuned on VGGFace2. I loaded the ONNX model in C++, extracted 512-dimensional embeddings, and normalized them per FRVT requirements. For cases with multiple images per identity, I averaged embeddings to create robust templates, serialized as std::vector<uint8_t>. Managing memory efficiently during batch processing was a hurdle, but I overcame it with careful allocation.

Challenges: Ensuring invariance to face variations and optimizing memory usage. Outcome: I generated templates suitable for enrollment and search.
\subsection{Week 6: Building Enrollment and Finalization Functions}
Week 6 focused on coding the FRVT enrollment and finalization phases in C++. I implemented createFaceTemplate to process single or multiple images and finalizeEnrollment to serialize templates into an EDB file with a manifest mapping IDs to offsets. Ensuring thread safety and correct file formatting took extensive testing, as errors here could break the entire pipeline.

Challenges: Debugging file I/O issues and ensuring compliance with FRVT specs. Outcome: A functional enrollment pipeline for gallery creation.

\subsection{Week 7: Developing the Identification Search Function}
In Week 7, I built the identifyTemplate function for 1:N search, using cosine similarity to compare probe templates against the gallery. I implemented a brute-force search to return the top-50 candidates, optimizing it to meet the 10-second constraint for 1 million templates. Handling edge cases (e.g., failed enrollments) required additional logic, making this a complex task.

Challenges: Achieving speed without sacrificing accuracy was difficult with brute-force search. Outcome: A working search function, though needing further optimization.
\subsection{Week 8: Testing and Debugging with the NIST Test Harness}
Week 8 involved testing the prototype with the NIST test harness, a black-box environment that exposed numerous issues. I faced cryptic errors like latency spikes and crashes on specific CPUs, spending hours reproducing and fixing them. Adjustments included tweaking memory usage and ensuring single-threaded execution, which was frustrating but educational.

Challenges: Interpreting test harness errors and resolving compatibility issues. Outcome: The system passed validation, though two errors remained for final submission.
\subsection{Week 9: Final Optimization and Submission}
In the final week, I addressed the NIST feedback: increased latency and failure on two CPUs. I profiled the code, optimized template creation and search (e.g., preallocating memory), and tested across configurations. After fixing these, I evaluated accuracy (FNIR=0.05 at FPIR=0.01) and timing, ensuring all FRVT criteria were met. This week tied everything together, culminating in a successful submission.

Challenges: Balancing speed and stability across environments. Outcome: A fully compliant FRVT 1:N system ready for certification.


\section{Related Work}
Below we survey four representative works that informed our design:

\subsection{TransFace: Calibrating Transformer Training for Face Recognition [1]}
Jun Dan \emph{et al.} identify that off-the-shelf Vision Transformers und{Week 4: Implementing Face Detection and Alignment with RetinaFace}erperform on large-scale face datasets due to data augmentation and sampling mismatches. They introduce \textbf{DPAP}, a patch-level augmentation in the Fourier domain that perturbs amplitude of dominant patches while preserving structural cues, and \textbf{EHSM}, an entropy-based hard sample mining that weights local token difficulty. Their TransFace model, trained on Glint360K and finetuned on VGGFace2 and IJB-C, achieves a TAR of 97.61\% at FAR=1e-4, demonstrating that data-centric strategies can unlock ViT potential for face recognition.

\subsection{RetinaFace: Single-stage Dense Face Localisation in the Wild [2]}
Jiankang Deng \emph{et al.} propose RetinaFace, a one-stage detector that augments traditional box classification and regression with extra-supervised landmark prediction (five facial points) and self-supervised 3D mesh decoding branches. They manually annotate five landmarks on WIDER FACE, boosting AP by 1.1\% (to 91.4\%) on the hard subset, and show that integrating dense 3D facial shape supervision further improves downstream verification (e.g., TAR=89.59\% at FAR=1e-6 on IJB-C). Notably, RetinaFace runs in real-time on a single CPU core, highlighting the power of multi-task learning for robust localization.

\subsection{ArcFace: Additive Angular Margin Loss for Deep Face Recognition [3]}
Jiankang Deng \emph{et al.} introduce ArcFace, which adds an \emph{additive angular margin} $m$ to the target logit via $\cos(\theta + m)$ on normalized embeddings, directly optimizing the geodesic distance margin on a hypersphere. To mitigate noisy labels at scale, they extend to \emph{sub-center ArcFace}, assigning $K$ sub-centers per class and allowing noisy or hard samples to form secondary clusters. ArcFace achieves state-of-the-art results (e.g., 97.27\% TPR@FPR=1e-4 on IJB-C) with minimal code changes and negligible overhead, making it a de facto standard for large-scale face embedding training.

\subsection{YuNet: A Tiny Millisecond-level Face Detector [4]}
Wei Wu \emph{et al.} design YuNet, an anchor-free, ultra-lightweight face detector optimized for edge devices. By analyzing the distribution of face sizes in WIDER FACE, they craft a compact backbone and streamlined feature fusion neck, resulting in only 75,856 parameters and under 2 ms inference on an Intel i7-12700K CPU. A training distribution alignment strategy ensures that the detector sees the same scale statistics at train and test time, yielding 81.1\% mAP on the WIDER FACE hard validation set. YuNet demonstrates that careful architecture and data-sampling choices can achieve millisecond-level detection without sacrificing accuracy.


\section{Methodology}
Figure~\ref{fig:pipeline} illustrates our system pipeline. We adopt a modular design:

\subsection{Overview}
We use a sequence of face processing and recognition components integrated with the FRVT 1:N API. The system comprises enrollment, finalization, and identification modes. Enrollment involves generating templates from face images using detection, alignment, and embedding. Finalization prepares the gallery for search, and identification compares a probe against the gallery using cosine similarity.

  \caption{System pipeline for FRVT 1:N implementation.}
  \label{fig:pipeline}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Algorithmic Flow}
Algorithm~\ref{alg:frvt} outlines the high-level flow of enrollment and identification processes.

\begin{algorithm}[htbp]
\caption{FRVT 1:N Recognition Pipeline}
\label{alg:frvt}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
  \STATE \textbf{Input:} Enrollment images $\{I_e\}$, probe images $\{I_p\}$
  \STATE \textbf{Output:} Candidate list for each probe
  \STATE initializeTemplateCreation(configDir, Enrollment_1N)
  \FOR{each image $I_e$ in $\{I_e\}$}
    \STATE $F_e \leftarrow$ detect\_and\_align($I_e$)
    \STATE $v_e \leftarrow$ extractEmbedding($F_e$)
    \STATE append $v_e$ to template set
  \ENDFOR
  \STATE finalizeEnrollment(configDir, enrollmentDir, edbName, manifestName, galleryType)
  \STATE initializeTemplateCreation(configDir, Search_1N)
  \STATE initializeIdentification(configDir, enrollmentDir)
  \FOR{each probe $I_p$ in $\{I_p\}$}
    \STATE $F_p \leftarrow$ detect\_and\_align($I_p$)
    \STATE $v_p \leftarrow$ extractEmbedding($F_p$)
    \STATE candidateList $\leftarrow$ identifyTemplate($v_p$, L)
    \STATE output candidateList
  \ENDFOR
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Component-Wise Description}

We detail the working of each core component shown in the main algorithm and the flowchart:

\textbf{InitializeTemplateCreation:} Loads configuration parameters and model paths (e.g., ONNX files). Prepares the system either for enrollment or search.

\textbf{Detect and Align:} Uses RetinaFace to detect the largest face and its landmarks. Applies similarity transform to align faces to 128x128 crops for pose normalization.

\textbf{ExtractEmbedding:} Preprocesses the face crop and feeds it to TransFace. The 512-dimensional embedding is normalized, and optionally averaged with its flipped counterpart.

\textbf{FuseTemplates:} Averages embeddings across multiple images of the same subject. Ensures a unified and robust representation.

\textbf{FinalizeEnrollment:} Serializes all fused templates to an EDB file and generates a manifest file mapping subject IDs to byte offsets.

\textbf{InitializeIdentification:} Loads EDB and manifest. Normalizes and stores all gallery templates in RAM for rapid search.

\textbf{IdentifyTemplate:} Computes cosine similarity between probe and gallery templates. Returns a sorted candidate list with top-L scores.

\textbf{Summary:} This modular architecture enables pluggability and clear separation of responsibilities. Each block can be independently debugged or replaced (e.g., with future embedding models).


\section{Experimental Setup}
All tests used a CPU-only server (Intel Xeon Gold 6140 @ 2.30GHz, 40 cores, 128 GB RAM, Ubuntu 20.04). No GPU was active during FRVT timing. We evaluated on the NIST-provided consolidated gallery ($N$ templates) and probe set ($M$ images), with candidate list length $L=50$. Pre-trained models tested: detectors (SCRFD, RetinaFace, YOLOFace, YuNet) and embeddings (ArcFace, AdaFace, TransFace, ResNet-100). TransFace finetuned on VGGFace2 with augmentations (random crop, color jitter, Gaussian noise) on an 8×RTX4090 cluster.

\section{Results}
